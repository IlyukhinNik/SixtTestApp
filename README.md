# User Story

Implement SIXT company iOS Coding Task

## Description

As an iOS engineer I want a small native app that displays a group of cars on a map and a list, so I can see if you are the iOS developer we are looking for.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Implement an iOS app that retrieves and displays our cars both on a map and on a list.
- The list of cars can be found at https://cdn.sixt.io/codingtask/cars. In case any car images are missing, use a fall-back image.
- You may use any external frameworks and libraries you like, just add a short note explaining why
you chose them.
- Please use Swift with the latest devtools.
- Show us what you care about when it comes to architecture, structure, clean code, UI/UX, error-
handling and automated testing.
- Share your code with us either via Github, Bitbucket, zip file. Etc.

## Designs

Up to you ;)
